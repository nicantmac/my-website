            Nick Mack! To start off my tech journey began a very long time ago but not like
            the prevalent notorious stories I heard growing up which was "I've been programming since I was 10-years-old"
            or "getting hands-on with robotics at 7". I grew up far from the hectic world of technology. I loved playing with Legos and
            video games, and occasionally assembling and disassembling arbitrary items i.e. pens, toy cars, etc. I've always had a knack for
            figuring out how things worked which is why my family didn't become surprised as I chose to pursue this route. Especially
            cars, but never really considered pursuing a field that required immense brainpower.

            In addition to growing up, I preferred staying out of the spotlight. Life wasn't particularly hard, but being an outlier in society
            made me a target for occasional bullying, which definitely caused me to get further and further into this rabbit hole kind of.
            I definitely avoided public speaking and leadership roles as those are the biggest two I'm working myself through. Moreover, with that
            occurring, it didn't me but just find more comfort in staying unnoticed. This tendency to avoid uncomfortable situations hindered growth
            and kept me from speaking up.

            As I entered college, I found myself unsure of what major to choose. Soooo, I decided to test the waters with different stem fields and eventually
            stumbling upon a Computer Science class. The moment I saw coding, I was weirdly reminded of building with Legos and noticed how connected I was
            instead of boredom. The only difference was that instead of physical blocks, I was now working with lines of code in an IDE or terminal.
            It was like constructing intricate structures, but in a digital world.

            The more I delved into Computer Science, the more I just genuinely enjoyed it. However, I knew the fun wouldn't last forever. Immersing myself in this
            new environment meant preparing to be uncomfortable, surrounded by incredibly smart individuals and grappling with concepts I never thought I'd encounter.
            These topics were some of the hardest he had ever faced. About a year into my college journey, I met <a id="adri" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adrienbaumert/" target="_blank">Adrien Baumert</a>, a significant influence
            on my path. From the first day we met, he noticed my extremely doubtful way of thinking towards myself and helped me reform in the right direction. Adrien encouraged
            me to overcome my self-doubt, dismiss bad assumptions, and avoid dwelling on "what-ifs." One of Adrien's suggestions was for me to get on LinkedIn, as he knew that community would be heart-warming and welcoming to an
            individual of this background. Before this suggestion, I had barely heard of LinkedIn and had no interest in it. Adrien made him realize the importance of networking and connecting with others, both inside and outside the industry, for incredible
            opportunities and growth. I began to understand the value of stepping out of a comfort zone, realizing that being in uncomfortable situations, not always being the smartest one in the room, struggling with difficult concepts, and dealing with failure
            were all part of the journey, and soon enough I've learned to embrace these challenges instead of embarrassing them.

                <p><strong>Remote - Long Island City, NY, United States - July 2024 - September 2024</strong></p>
                <!--<p>As a Software Engineering fellow @ Headstarter AI, over 5 weeks (July 2024 - Sept 2024), I will be working on five AI related projects, aiming to scale up to great depths with my final project which is taking a small startup's current background and build it using biz requirements. This SWE opportunity enhanced my vision and potential, my very own personal brand, various interview prep skills, and importance of network and collaboration.</p>-->
                <p>During the first two weeks, I focused on a solo project, where fellows created a personal website. Then soon enough our team decided to gather and collaboratively develop a Pantry Tracker application. For these projects, I utilized HTML, CSS, ReactJS, and Next.js.
                    In the subsequent weeks we gained very rigorous tasks. However, leading into these upcoming weeks with a lovely teammate <a id="hsai-team"href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sadiatijjani/" target="_blank">Sadia Tijjani</a>, we couldn't wait to lean and embrace the SWE journey together. We developed an AI Customer Support system and integrated it with OpenAI, Next.js, and AWS. This was followed by the AI Flashcards & Stripe project, where I worked on integrating OpenAI, Auth, and StripeAPI functionalities.
                    Later, I contributed to an imitation of Rate My Professor utilizing AI, particularly involved using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), OpenAI, and vector-based technologies.
                    In the final phase, we focused on the project Track B, which was concentrating on branding, meeting deadlines, and enhancing the user interface of a small startups biz requirements. We culminated the experience by presenting our work to an Software engineer, effectively communicating our project outcomes and goals.</p>
